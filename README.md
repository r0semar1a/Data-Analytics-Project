# Data-Analytics-Project

The project's dataset focuses on understanding the factors influencing the number of deaths in each Indian State. The key variables include the proportion of public healthcare workers, the number of beds available in rural and urban hospitals, the number of primary health centers, the total staff per bed, community health centers, and sub-district hospitals.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and visualize the dataset to gain insights into healthcare facilities and their impact on mortality rates in Indian States.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Explore summary statistics to understand the distribution of key variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilize various visualizations, such as pie charts, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.

## Why This Project?

Understanding the factors contributing to mortality rates is crucial for public health planning and resource allocation. This project aims to provide valuable insights that can guide policymakers and healthcare professionals in improving medical facilities and services across Indian States.
